/// `DirectRemoteController` is a struct that represents a remote controller for the LEGOÂ® Power Functions IR Remote Control 8885.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `channel` - The channel on which the remote controller operates.
/// * `pulse_transmitter` - A reference to an object that implements the `PulseTransmitter` trait, used to send pulses.
/// * `protocol` - An instance of `ComboDirectProtocol` used to encode commands.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Although the internal protocol used by `DirectRemoteController` is stateless (it does not maintain mutable state),
/// the public API requires a mutable reference (i.e. the `send` method takes `&mut self`), which prevents concurrent use.
/// If you must share an instance across threads, wrap the controller (or the underlying transmitter) in a synchronization primitive (e.g. a `Mutex`).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This struct's methods will return an error if the protocol fails to encode the command or if the pulse transmitter fails to send pulses.
